**RPG Player .NET Backend**

Inspired by classic RPG video games. This backend was built to simulate a professional web service API. Applicaiton uses techniques and best practices such as Service Response Objects, DTOs, Dependency Injections, Services and follows an MVC archtecture. This API was constructed to help solidfy my .NET/C# knowledge and help draw comparisons between other backend languages/framewords such as Node.js.

Please note: Included are notes taken from both the web and the [.NET/C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio) docs found online
